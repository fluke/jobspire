      <h1>Thanks for supporting us.</h1>
      <p>Late last year, Jobspire was acquired by a NYC-based company. Since then, we've been building incredible new tools to bring tech talent recruitment to the modern world. None of this would've been possible without you, our users, and we can't thank you enough for it. We'll be back soon!</p>
